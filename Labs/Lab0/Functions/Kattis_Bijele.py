Algorithm Steps:
    Input 6 numbers separated by a space
    Set varibles for # pieces there are supposed to be
    Write 6 line, one for each set of pieces, 
        taking the difference between actual pieces and pieces required

# FIXMEs 3,4 make varibles for remaining pieces (2 knights, 8 pawns) #FIXED#

#FIXMEs 5,6: make dif5 and dif6  #FIXED#

#FIXME 7: call solution function passing proper parameters
